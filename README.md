# House-Price-Prediction-using-ANN

This project leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict house prices based on features like area, location, number of rooms, and more. Built using Python, Pandas, and TensorFlow/Keras, the model is trained on a structured dataset with the goal of minimizing prediction error and improving real-world estimation accuracy.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized data for optimal ANN performance.

Model Architecture: Multi-layer perceptron with ReLU activation and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

Evaluation: Trained and tested with metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ² Score.

Visualization: Includes loss and accuracy plots to track model performance during training.

User-Focused: Designed to be easily extended or deployed for real-estate-based applications.
